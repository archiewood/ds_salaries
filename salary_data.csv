This is especially true if you're not in big tech. Even in big tech, Principal Engineers, Distinguished Engineers, and Technical Fellows are a lot less common than Directors, Senior Directors and VPs.","Something like only 10% of employees even go beyond L5 as an IC. IMHO the equivalent of L7 is the likely ceiling for most ICs even in big tech, unless you're among the few experts in the world on a certain topic and can influence organizations of 100s of people without actually managing them. If you're not in big tech and not in a tech hub the ceiling is likely a lot lower.","That said, don't move to management only as a way to grow in your career. You start becoming responsible for other people's career growth, and livelihood. Approach it with the seriousness it deserves. So many shitty people end up in leadership roles because of their ambition, but they lack basic people skills to be able to handle conflicts within teams and between teams, which results in unwarranted drama and pain. It's sad!",There are really good books about management I can recommend if you choose to go into the management track.,,,,,

2021,2,"Finance?  Absolutely not.  If you want to be a quant, get a STEM PhD.  Math, physics, CS with a specialty in AI/ML, statistics.  Definitely not Finance or Econ.  (And honestly, probably not physics.  Just do math/CS.).  The nice part is if the quant thing doesn't work out, you still have marketable skills.","As for whether you should get any PhD, my default answer is ""no"" unless it's just something that you yearn for strongly - you give up a lot going to a PhD.  Some people have a great time, many do not.  And it'll be hard to go from making a lot of money (if you are now) to eating ramen for 4-6 years.  It's a rough life.  My advisor was great and I went to an elite school, but I still don't look back that fondly on getting my PhD.   A masters is almost always worth it, but a PhD is a really big gamble.","There's plenty of demand, in the sense that many people get hired, but it's very competitive because there are a lot of PhDs these days.  Probably too many.  If you get a STEM PhD from a good school, you'll have no trouble getting interviews, but that's no guarantee you'll get a decent offer.   I wouldn't recommend getting a PhD just to goose your job prospects (in finance or otherwise).  That's part of it, but it's a bit of a slog, so make sure you actually enjoy the work and don't count on getting a job at one of a small number of firms.  You'll definitely get a job, but it might not be a dream job and it might not be in finance.  (OTOH, it might be a dream job!  You never know.)","Uh, not what I would call typical, regardless of which school you go to.  I'm (a) pretty senior and (b) at one of the bigger funds.   I would guess most of my more junior colleagues make $300k-$1 million/year, heavily depending on which firm they work for.   It doesn't matter how smart you are, if you're at a smaller fund, you're not making millions/year.    Of course that still a lot of money, but you can make $500k-$1 million as a senior developer at a FAANG company and have a more sane work-life balance and better job mobility (no non-compete clauses).","Just to be clear, I reported this to add information to the thread, but you definitely shouldn't take it as an endorsement of this career path.  There's a lot of variance of outcomes.  I have a number of friends who make well into 7 figures, but I also have a number who capped out at like $500k and left the industry in disgust to go work at a FAANG company because they hated the finance culture.   I would actually rather do something else, but I want to milk it for another couple of years before quitting finance forever.  If I got fired tomorrow, I honestly wouldn't be too upset.",,,,,,
